This website is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, which is an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

Beyond this, the styling for this website directly combines 2 templates:
* Lanyon - [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
* LateXJekyll - [LatexJekyll](https://github.com/Hammie217/LatexJekyll) a latex styled jekyll theme.

Beyond this I have added a Dark theme in the menu, I found the code from some Medium blog, the colours are oddly inverted. But it worked and my care for perfection is limited.

This was an attempt to make an attractive content focussed webpage whilst reducing the bloat.
