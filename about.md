# Research Interests

## Handling



## Fusion Remote Handling

{:.BodyText .Justified}
While working at the UK Atomic Energy Authority and having the opportunity to be an Eurofusion Fellow early in my career, I have had the occassion to build a large amount of experience in Fusion maintenance robotics. I have worked on robotics systems for JET(Joint European Torus), ITER, and DEMO remote maintenance.

I have an encyclopedic knowledge on all the reason on why robotics in a fusion reactor or 
maintenance plant is stupidly difficult and why the requirements push every design to the extreme. For example, the blanket handling system for DEMO, which is 70 tonne robotic moving system that has to lift a 200 tonne assymetric payload filled 100 tonnes of solid-liquid lithium-lead going through a phase transition. Lifting the 15m blanket, through a hole with a 1 cm clearance with 2kiloGrays per hours of gamma precluding the use os most modern sensor systems. All of this in timely fashio to reduce the price per Watt.

I have had the opportunity to support in the deployment of Digital twins, Robotics, control systems, distributed systems, Autonomous systems, Computer vision systems, planning and scheduling systems, and many other things.

## Other challenging environments

Space Robotics, well my PhD was in space robotics

Decommissioning Robotics, my Job title is Key Lead for Decom, which translates Chief technical for decom robotics, UKAEA.

Thanks for reading whatever this webpage is. A slow breakdown? maybe.
