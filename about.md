# Research and Engineering Interests

## Handling
{:.BodyText .Justified}
I am deeply excited with getting Robotic Handling working, where I define robotic handling as:

> A robotic handling system is a robotic system capable of manipulating objects with a large amount of pre-determined uncertainty in the task and environment. 

{:.BodyText .Justified}
I have had the opportunity to work on a vairety systems of various scales around Hnadling in challenging environments; for example, nuclear gloveboxes.
In particular, developing Teleoperation, Autonmation, Autonomy, semi-autonomy, hardware for handling, and digital twins.

### Teleoperation
{:.BodyText .Justified}
I have experimented with a range of teleoperation techniques, having developed multiple input devices, control schemes, and software for teleoperations; such as, VR-based control, haptic gloves, controller-based, symmetric telemanipulators (using cobots as input and output haptic devices) and assymmetric tele-manipulators (e.g. [haptions](https://www.haption.com/en/products-en/virtuose-6d-en.html)). I have also had the opportunity to collaborate extensively on teleoperation optimised inverse kinematics. 

### Automation
{:.BodyText .Justified}
Integrating automation into a handling system is non-trivial due to the increased level of uncertainty.


### Autonomy and Semi Autonomy
{:.BodyText .Justified}
* Autonomous grasping - Structured and unstructured grapsing
* Autonomous Wipiing/sweeping
* Autonomous tool use
* Semi-autonomy - safely adapting autonomy with tele-operation
* Rapid path planning and execution
* Collision aware IK
* Task planning
* Novel condition monitoring


### Hardware
 {:.BodyText .Justified}
 I am currently working on a concept for a different type of robot suitable for Handling. In particular, robots capable manipulating payloads multiple times their weight for short periods of time, through variable accuracy and stiffness. I am defintely going to blogging on this topic more. 


### Digital Twins
 {:.BodyText .Justified}
 * Photo-realistic live digital twins, for limited view operations, operation planning, and dataset generation.
 * Mixed-reality for operations.
 * Operation management systems.
 

## Fusion Remote Handling

{:.BodyText .Justified}
While working at the UK Atomic Energy Authority and having the opportunity to be an Eurofusion Fellow early in my career, I have had the occassion to build a large amount of experience in Fusion maintenance robotics. I have worked on robotics systems for JET(Joint European Torus), ITER, and DEMO remote maintenance. 

{:.BodyText .Justified}
I have an encyclopedic knowledge on all the reason on why robotics in a fusion reactor or 
maintenance plant is stupidly difficult and why the requirements push every design to the extreme. For example, the blanket handling system for DEMO, which is 70 tonne robotic moving system that has to lift a 200 tonne assymetric payload filled 100 tonnes of solid-liquid lithium-lead going through a phase transition. Lifting the 15m blanket, through a hole with a 1 cm clearance with 2kiloGrays per hours of gamma precluding the use os most modern sensor systems. All of this in timely fashio to reduce the price per Watt.

{:.BodyText .Justified}
I have had the opportunity to support in the deployment of Digital twins, Robotics, control systems, distributed systems, Autonomous systems, Computer vision systems, planning and scheduling systems, and many other things.

## Other challenging environments

Space Robotics, well my PhD was in space robotics

Decommissioning Robotics, my Job title is Key Lead for Decom, which translates Chief technical for decom robotics for the UK Atomic Energy Authority.

# Selected Publications

* Soon if I can be bothered

# Hobbie

{:.BodyText .Justified}
As part of my inability to sit still for more than 2 minutes, I have a wide range of hobbies that I don't spend enough time on.

 * Learning french
 * UK WIldlife research
 * Long term mission Autonomous sail boats
 * Kayaking
 * HEMA
 * Gardening

Thanks for reading whatever this webpage is. A slow breakdown? maybe.
